MODIFIED by the Erdős–Gallai formalization project (formal/comparator/Solution.lean), from
google-deepmind/formal-conjectures@2424bb480c590237ffbb2cc831ae4cb8977e045a
FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/184.lean (= formal/comparator/Challenge.lean, byte-identical).
Changes: two private imports of the project; the proof of `erdos_184` (was `sorry`) replaced by
the FC-184-free bridge applied to `EG.Proof.mainInternal`; the five `variants` theorems (all
`sorry`, not claimed) removed. Everything else is verbatim. This is comparator's `Solution`
(leanprover/comparator); see formal/comparator/README.md.
